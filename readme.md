Project Name : Emergency Service Directory

📌Project Overview :
Emergency Service Directory is a responsive web application that provides quick access to important emergency hotline numbers in Bangladesh.
The application is designed to help users easily find, copy, and call emergency services from a single platform with an interactive coin-based calling system and call history tracking.
